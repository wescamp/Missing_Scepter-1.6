    description= _ "Homz childhood was spent in training similar to that of Red Mages, but later became interested in using deductive reasoning to solve crimes. 'From a pad of butter,' Homz writes, 'a logician could infer the possibility of a cow or a goat without having seen or heard of one or the other.' Homzian deductive process appears to be primarily of drawing inferences based from observing items found in kitchens. In Wesnoth, many of his monograms on states of parsley tumescence or fat density in butter and cheeses can be found--because, seriously, no one wants to read such things, so they are on bookstores shelves collecting dust.
    
Unlike his brother Mycrokroft, Homz tries not to aid Queen Asheviere while not trying to hurt the people of Wesnoth. Instead, he keeps to solving crimes and creating investigation procedures for Weldyn's nascent police force.

Long experience with chemicals has given Homz the ability to make poison antidotes.

Having tracked many underworld criminals in Weldyn, Homz can conceal himself from the enemy when in a village.
    
The elder Homz wears a deerstaker with a brown and yellow houndstooth pattern. Mostly, he does this to hide his hair loss but it does help camouflage himself in the field from creatures that can't see in color.
